# HackerRankCodes

Here under HackerRankCodes you may find some of my implementations which are repliable, fast and (almost) efficient. 
I herewith particularly concentrate in writing clean, understandable code. (Particularly in Java)
These are the basic practice exercises, and I like coding and solving puzzles. The bliss of striving to find a solution is more important to me than having a readymade solution. And therefore I belive hackerrank is a great place to practice coding.
